#
# --- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---
#
# A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a passphrase instead
# of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by
# spaces.
#
# To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.
#
# For example:
#
# aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
# aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
# aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.
#
# The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are
# valid?
#
# --- Part Two ---
#
# For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must
# contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any
# word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.
#
# For example:
#
# abcde fghij is a valid passphrase.
# abcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.
# a ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.
# iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.
# oiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.
# Under this new system policy, how many passphrases are valid?
